    <h1>Cat Babysitter</h1>

    <p>Stop me if this doesn’t sound too familiar: you just got yourself a baby, they are super cute, you love them
        more than anything in the world, but a new Avengers movie is playing in your local cinema, and you have to see
        it
        but you can’t find a babysitter. We’ve all been there.</p>
    <p>That’s why we are introducing Cat Babysitter! Mew!</p>

    <h2>Cat Babysitter!</h2>
    <p class="customer-saying"><em>Wow!</em> Tell me more!</p>
    <p>Here are five fun, and very likely completely legal, reasons why our cats make purrfect babysitters:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Masters of Stealth</strong>: Cats can silently observe, making sure everything's fine without
            disturbing nap time. </li>
        <li><strong>Natural Entertainers</strong>: From pouncing on toys to chasing shadows, cats can keep babies amused
            with their playful antics.</li>
        <li><strong>Warm and Cuddly</strong>: Cats provide the best snuggles, perfect for calming little ones down or
            encouraging naptime.</li>
        <li><strong>Impeccable Groomers</strong>: Always clean and tidy, cats set a good example for babies on personal
            hygiene (without the bath time tantrums).</li>
        <li><strong>Calm Yet Watchful</strong>: Cats have a zen-like presence but are always alert, ready to check on
            any strange noise or sudden movement.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Just keep the snack bowl full and the laser pointer handy!</p>

    <p class="customer-saying">Wait, I am confused. I thought that you were referring to cats as babies, which is a bit weird in and of itself,
        but it turns out what you are suggesting is that the actual cats be the actual babysitters for the actual
        babies?
    </p>

    <p>Yes, I don’t get the confusion.</p>
